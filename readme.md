## Welcome to the lecture notes for the Data Analyst program at Hyper Island

The notes are written in the format of .ipynb for Jupyter Notebooks. The reason for this is twofold. First of all it is one of the tools of the data analyst and it is therefore good to get practice with the tool and second notes in Jupyter Notebooks enables us to write both notes and code in the same document. 

## Getting started with Jupyter Notebooks

While you don't need Jupyter Notebooks just to read the notes on Github I would recommend installning it since we will be using it later in the program and it enables you to open the files on your local computer. 

It is not very difficult to install it. Will take you at most 10 minutes. 

We are going to install the Python distrubtion made by Anadonda that includes Jupyter Notebooks. That is all you need to get started. 

Go here: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ 

Choose the Python 3.7 version for your operating system. If you are on a mac that means you go to this address https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2019.07-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg and if you are on a windows choose this address: https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2019.07-Windows-x86_64.exe . If you are on linux I'm sure you don't need the help. 

Then you just start the installer and follow all the default steps. If you are on a mac I would only install it on "This user" and not every user on the computer. I had some small issues with it when I did that and had to reinstall it (maybe not a problem for you but just a recommendation). 

When you finished installing it you can open Jupyter Notebooks. If you don't have chrome already it is recommended to get it since it works best in chrome (but other modern browsers that are not Internet Explorer/Edge). There are two ways to open Jupyter Notebooks. 

1. Using the Anaconda Navigator

Open Anaconda Navigator from the application menu. Then you should see the homescreen and one of the boxes contains "Jupyter Notebook". Press "Launch" and it will launch Jupyter Notebook. 

2. Using the terminal

Just open your terminal and type "jupyter notebook" and boom it should open up in Chrome. 

### Using Jupyter Notebook

When first launching Jupyter Notebook you are in a file-navigator. From here you can either create a new file or open an existing jupyter notebook. 

There is of course ALOT to know about Jupyter Notebook since it is a very powerful tool. But one basic thing is that you can write either markdown or python code (you can write other stuff too but lets forget about it for now). 

Most of the first notes will just contain markdown because we have still not studied any python so there is no code to write. Markdown is a common standard for formatting documents. It gives you full control over the formatting of a document by letting you write your formatting as simple "code/syntaxing". For example if you want to make a heading you just put a hashtagg infont of it like this: "# This would be a header"
